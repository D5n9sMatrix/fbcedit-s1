Psalm 23

David proclaims: The Lord is my pastor.

David's Psalm.

1 The Lord is my apartment, nothing will be lacking.

2 Lying me in green pastures;Guide me softly to quiet waters.

3 Refrigerates my soul;Guide me through the paths of justice, because of his name.

4 Although I walked through the avale of the shadow of death, I would fear no harm, because you are with me;Your stick and your staff comfort me.

5 prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies;anxes my head with oil;My chalice overflows.

6 Certainly, goodness and amisericord will follow me every day of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
